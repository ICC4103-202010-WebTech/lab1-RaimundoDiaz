3.3 So, what i see is that under the main head and body of the html page it has the hnmain table that is bassically everything, and then inside hnmain there are 3 rows (tr), first row is like the head, the second row is the body of the page that contains all the news, this row has a table without id, but inside it there are more rows, in wich every row i either a news or the separation of the news. Then going back to the hnmain table, the third row is for more information like security, support, FAQ, etc.

3.4 What i see in the sources tab, inside the hn.js file is like a repository with all the functions used by the web page.

3.5 Then inside the news.css file, i think it is all the font sizes, the font types and the colors used by the web page in every table

3.5 I see 7 requests, in every case the method used is GET, in the same headers tab i found a row called server and it says it is NGINX. I googled it and i think it is the webserver por the webpage.
